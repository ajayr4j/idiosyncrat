# About

## Problem

* Every content we encounter in the social media or in the internet is not unique and heavily replicated. 
* Which makes us to engage with the replicated content again and again.

## Proposed Statement

* My idea is to build a prototype as a first step.
* We basically have the following forms of content we consume:
  * Text
  * Image
  * Video
* So, the wholistic idea is that if a feed is served with a list which contains any of the above mentioned forms. We should be able to only show the unique content and remove the duplicate content from the yet to be served feed list.


## First step

* Work on converting the text, image, video into a metadata, which can be used for comparison.
* My ideas,
   * For text - NLP
   * For Image - Image processing techniques
   * For video - YOLO kindof algorithm or same as image processing. But, by breaking down several frames from the video.
 


# Happy and open to collaborate for further ideas.

And, This is only a fun project :)
